# VaccinePass


The goal of VaccinePass is to bring programmability and interoperability to pharmaceuticals blockchain as we call it VaccineChain.

VaccinePass is designed to connect multiple systems that are all integral to vaccination delivery. Our solution allows different stakeholders to execute their tasks and for the companies responsible for managing the rollout to obtain real time insights on the planâ€™s  performance based on reliable information. At the same time VaccinePass maintains the highest security and privacy protection due to the nature of blockchain.

VaccineChain is developed on go-ethereum fork.
